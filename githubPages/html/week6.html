                        This is the Timeline for our project, highlighting the key milestones and deliverables required at specific times. 
                        It spans from week 7 to 12, tracking our progress from the previous meeting up to the semester's end. Our immediate priority is the development of the 
                        web application, after which we will shift our attention to the mobile app. The accompanying image provides a 
                        visual representation of the timeline, though it may be difficult to discern the details. For a clearer view, 
                        please refer to the full-sized image and additional meeting-related documents available in the <a href="#resources" style="scroll-behavior: smooth;">resources section</a> at the end of the page through the provided link.

                    <h2> Use Case Diagram </h2>
                    <p>
                        We created a use case diagram to visually represent the interactions between the users and the Freight Shield System. 
                        This diagram serves as a tool to communicate the various functionalities available to different users within the system. 
                        The 'Admin' role is responsible for checking both shipper and carrier compliance, while the 'Shipper' has the ability to 
                        post a load, which then appears on the shipper dashboard. The 'Carrier Dashboard' enables the 'Dispatcher' to pick a load 
                        and assign a driver, and it also extends to features such as live tracking and logbook integration. The 'Driver' interacts 
                        with the system via the mobile app, utilizing it for live updates. These interactions are streamlined and interconnected, 
                        ensuring that each user has the necessary tools and information to perform their roles effectively within the logistics 
                        and shipment tracking process.

                    <h2> Sequence Diagram </h2>
                    <p>
                        We have created a sequence diagram to show the order of actions within the Freight Shield System, mapping out 
                        the communication between different components and stakeholders. The process begins with the 'Shipper' posting 
                        a load, which is then sent to the 'Shipper Dashboard' and subsequently displayed on the 'Loadboard'. As the 
                        sequence progresses, the 'Logbook' receives and sends data, playing a pivotal role in maintaining records. 
                        'Live Tracking' is an integral feature that enables the sending and receiving of real-time location updates to 
                        and from the 'Mobile App', ensuring the 'Driver' is continually updated. On the receiving end, the 'Carrier 
                        Dashboard' is where the 'Dispatcher' interacts with the system, visualizing the load and then assigning it to 
                        the 'Driver'. Notifications and data exchange between the 'Shipper', 'Driver', and 'Dispatcher' facilitate a 
                        cohesive operational environment, showcasing the system's ability to synchronize logistics and communication 
                        effectively.
